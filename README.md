# DDO-Translation
This is a repository for the translation of Dragon's Dogma Online.

This is a community translation project.

## Credits

Many of the translations are taken from or adapted from the excellent work of other teams or people:
* [Dragon's Dogma Online Translations](http://ddonline.tumblr.com/) and their wiki [The White Dragon Temple](http://ddon.wikidot.com/). Their wiki is a great reference for playing DDON!
* [Julien-schu](http://julien-schu.tumblr.com/). Julien-schu's blog is a great resource for keeping up to date with news on DDON.

## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to the translation effort, please feel free to open a pull request or contact [/u/Crevox on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/Crevox).

## Contribution Guide
When doing translation please open up your own branch for your changes. When you feel that your edits are ready for review, please open a pull request to have your branch merged into master. This lets people see your request along with the changes, and allows everyone to comment/feedback on it before merging. If you are unsure of how branching works please read the GitHub wiki or other guides on Git branching.

Each XML file has an entry for the original Japanese text encased in an &lt;origina&gt;&lt;/original&gt; tag. When entering in your translation simply press enter to make a new line and encase your translated text in a &lt;translation&gt;&lt;/translation&gt; tag. If you are unsure of what this looks like please take a look at some files that have already been translated to see an example.

If you have any questions, feel free to [PM me on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Crevox) and I will try my best to answer them.
