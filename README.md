# DDO-Translation

This is a repository for the translation of Dragon's Dogma Online.

To collaborate: PM me on reddit (/u/SpartanVXL) with your Github username or email address and I will add you to the repo

If you are new to Git or version control please take some time to read through Github's guide on using Git here: https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/

Once confirmed as a collaborator you can now edit the files in the repository.
From the main repo page you can select files from the folders listed to edit them.
Each change to a file(s) is a save ('commit') to the repository and changes the version of the code. All versions are saved and can be rolled/switched back to so any errors can be undone easily.

If you have any questions PM me on Reddit and I will try my best to answer them.
